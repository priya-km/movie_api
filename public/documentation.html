            application will provide users with access to information about different
            movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
            personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies. 
            </p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Return a list of ALL movies to the user</li>
        <li>Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it's featured or not) about a single movie by title to the user</li>
        <li>Return data about a genre (description) by name/title</li>
        <li>Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name</li>
        <li>Allow new users to register</li>
        <li>Allow users to update their user info</li>
        <li>Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites</li>
